    <h1>Cost of Living Across Australian States</h1>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        The cost of living in Australia varies across states, with different factors affecting the overall index, such as mortgage prices, rent, groceries, fuel, and electricity costs. To provide a comprehensive understanding of how these costs differ, the "Generalized Cost of Living Index" was created. This index normalizes the values across different categories to provide a composite score for each state.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Generalized Cost of Living Index is calculated using the Min-Max Normalization method, which rescaled the values for each category (Mortgage, Rent, Groceries, Fuel, Electricity) to a range between 0 and 1. This makes the values comparable across the different categories, ensuring consistency.
      </p>
      <p>
        Categories Used:
        <br><strong>Mortgage:</strong> Median house prices in each state's capital city.
        <br><strong>Rent:</strong> Average weekly rent for both units and houses in each city.
        <br><strong>Groceries:</strong> Average cost of various grocery items (e.g., milk, eggs, chicken breast) for each city.
        <br><strong>Fuel:</strong> Weekly fuel costs for each capital city.
        <br><strong>Electricity:</strong> Quarterly electricity bills for each state.
      </p>
      <p>
        The overall Generalized Cost of Living Index is derived by averaging the normalized values for each state across all categories.

      <h2>Pie Chart: Cost of Living Categories</h2>
      <p>
        The pie chart below breaks down the different categories contributing to the Generalized Cost of Living Index. Each category—Mortgage, Rent, Groceries, Fuel, and Electricity—plays a significant role in determining the overall cost of living in each state. Explore how each category weighs into the composite score for each state.

      <h2>Property, Loans, and Mortgages</h2>
      <p>
        One of the most significant components of the cost of living is property, which includes home prices, mortgage rates, and loans. Understanding loan commitments is crucial, as it reflects both economic activity and individual purchasing power in the housing market. The following visualizations provide insights into property value changes and loan commitments over time.
