    <h1>Home Buyer Loan Commitments Across Australian States</h1>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        In recent years, the housing market in Australia has been a subject of intense public interest and policy debate. 
        One of the major factors influencing the housing market is the rate of loan commitments made by home buyers across the country. 
        Understanding where the largest loan commitments are made provides insights into regional housing demand, 
        population growth, and economic trends. The following visualizations delve into the patterns of home buyer loan commitments 
        across different Australian states and over time. We explore which states have the highest loan activity and how the landscape of housing loans has evolved throughout the year.

      <h2>Map: Loan Commitments Across States</h2>
      <p>
        The map below provides a geographical breakdown of loan commitments across Australia's states and territories. 
        The darker the red, the higher the number of loan commitments in that state. The regional disparities 
        in loan commitments are immediately apparent, with some states demonstrating much stronger activity in the housing market 
        than others. Hover over each state to see specific loan commitment numbers, revealing that New South Wales and Victoria 
        stand out as the most active regions, likely driven by their large population centers and robust housing markets.
        This visual offers a snapshot of the distribution of home loan activities, underscoring the concentrated demand 
        in these urban areas.

      <h2>Line Chart: Loan Commitments Over Time</h2>
      <p>
        The line chart below tracks the number of loan commitments over the course of the year. Each state shows its 
        month-by-month loan commitment trends, providing a longitudinal view of how the housing market has evolved. 
        You’ll notice that loan commitments tend to fluctuate in a seasonal manner, with peaks in certain months that may 
        correspond with favorable economic conditions or housing policies. For example, we see significant spikes 
        in loan commitments during mid-year months, potentially tied to the conclusion of fiscal periods or 
        the announcement of government incentives for first-time homebuyers. Select a state in the tooltip to 
        further explore these trends.

      <h2>Bar Chart: Loan Commitments by State</h2>
      <p>
        The bar chart below provides a clear comparison of total loan commitments for each state. This comparison 
        highlights which states lead in housing loan commitments and which ones lag behind. Unsurprisingly, 
        New South Wales and Victoria lead the way, reflective of their large populations and bustling real estate markets. 
        Meanwhile, states like Tasmania and Northern Territory show relatively fewer commitments, consistent with 
        their smaller population sizes and less aggressive real estate development. The bar chart allows us to make 
        a direct comparison of the magnitude of loan commitments across Australia, presenting a clearer picture of the 
        housing market's regional dynamics.

      <h2>Pie Chart: Proportion of Loan Commitments by State</h2>
      <p>
        The pie chart below offers a proportional breakdown of loan commitments across Australia. Each slice represents 
        a state’s contribution to the overall market for home loan commitments. New South Wales and Victoria dominate, 
        making up the majority of commitments, followed by Queensland. Smaller slices, such as those representing 
        Tasmania and the Northern Territory, remind us of the disparities in housing market activities between larger 
        urban areas and more rural or remote regions. This proportional representation offers a holistic view of the 
        Australian housing market and highlights the dominant players in this economic space.
